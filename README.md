I was asked to create a website for a friend's concrete pouring enterprise. From exploring the websites of competitors, he had a vague idea of how he would like it to be designed, but ultimately I was given the freedom to choose which technologies would be most suitable for the project, and even the content displayed on the website itself.

I chose Phalcon as the MVC as I am most familiar with its features, and have used strictly conforming code standards and pest practices in development.
